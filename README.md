## Git LFS
We use Git LFS for dependencies that are expensive to build.

To make sure you have everything you need to start building, you'll need to
install the `git-lfs` package for your favourite operating system, then run the
following commands in this repo:

``` PowerShell
    git lfs install
    git lfs pull
```
