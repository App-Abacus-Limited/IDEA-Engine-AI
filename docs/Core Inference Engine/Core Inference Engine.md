# IDEA Engine Core Inference Engine

## Requirements Document: Core Inference Engine for Serving LLM, SLM, and LAM Models


### Objective
Develop a flexible, efficient, and secure core inference engine in Rust that uses the Candle framework to serve LLM, SLM, and LAM models according to agent demands. Store relevant metadata and vector data in SurrealDB and Qdrant, respectively, allowing easy access and manipulation.

### Functional Requirements

#### Data Management

* Support importing and exporting popular deep learning model file formats like ONNX, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Transformers.
* Efficient storage and retrieval of metadata associated with models, including names, versions, descriptions, and supported functions.
* Vector data indexing and searching using Qdrant.

#### Model Serving

* Handle incoming requests from agents and route them to appropriate models based on criteria defined in the routing strategy.
* Provide a configurable mechanism to fine-tune models dynamically based on user feedback or changing conditions.
* Enable multi-tenancy support, allowing different agents to share the same infrastructure securely.

#### Monitoring & Logging

* Collect essential runtime statistics and log events for further analysis and optimization.
* Export telemetry data to external systems for visualization and anomaly detection purposes.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance

* Minimize latency in model prediction time.
* Maximize throughput with minimal degradation due to increased numbers of simultaneous connections.

#### Security

* Comply with industry best practices and standards for encryption, authentication, authorization, and auditing.
* Secure sensitive data storage, transmission, and processing.

#### Scalability

* Design for horizontal scalability, supporting automatic distribution of compute capacity across multiple nodes.
* Allow dynamic addition and removal of nodes for elasticity.

### Additional Features

#### Configuration Management
A simple configuration management layer to allow users to define parameters such as number of worker threads, batch sizes, memory limits, and persistence settings.

#### Load Balancer
Integration with widely used load balancers to distribute traffic efficiently and prevent bottlenecks.

#### Tracing & Profiling
Implement tracing and profiling hooks to monitor end-to-end flows, detect hotspots, and pinpoint potential issues.

#### Test Coverage
Ensure comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests coverage to minimize regressions and enhance reliability.

#### Web Console
Design and develop a modern web console to visually inspect and configure different aspects of the inference engine, display analytics and diagnostics, and receive status alerts.

#### Alert Notifications
Implement alerting notification mechanisms to notify operators of critical situations requiring intervention, e.g., excessive queue lengths, failed jobs, network errors, low disk space, or hardware failures.

With this requirements document and recommended feature expansion, you should possess sufficient direction to begin designing a robust, secure, and extensible inference engine for serving LLM, SLM, and LAM models to various agents using Rust, Docker containers, SurrealDB, and Qdrant. Regularly review and update the requirements as needed to accommodate emerging technologies and evolving user expectations.
