# MinGW

Using MSYS2 and MinGW to install the GCC compiler on Windows. Here are the steps:

1. Download MSYS2 from the official website⁸.
2. After installing, navigate to the directory where it was installed, and run `msys2.exe`. For this tutorial, we will assume the default location of `C:\\msys64`.
3. Open the MSYS2 bash shell. You should find yourself in a bash shell.
4. Update all the packages using the command: `pacman -Syu`.
5. Install the build toolchain and compilers using the command: `pacman -S base-devel gcc vim cmake`. Note that `vim` and `cmake` are optional, but handy to have¹.
6. After installing those packages, you will have `gcc` and the other tools available to be used while in the MSYS2 shell.

Please note that if you want to use the toolchains (with installed libraries) outside of the MSYS2 environment, you need to add `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` to your PATH.

Remember to replace `x86_64` with `i686` if you are using a 32-bit operating system³⁴.
